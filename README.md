# Data Cleaning and Analysis of Global Financial and Macroeconomic Indicators (2000â€“Present)

## About

This project presents a structured analysis of macroeconomic and financial data drawn from a longitudinal dataset that spans from 2000 to the present, sourced from Kaggle. The dataset comprises daily records on key economic indicators, including GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, stock market performance, consumer spending, and currency exchange rates. Using SQL, the data was systematically cleaned, parsed, and standardized to enable robust and reproducible analysis. This involved resolving data inconsistencies, normalizing field names, and transforming temporal variables into a format amenable to time-series interrogation. The resulting schema supports multi-dimensional queries that reveal both high-frequency market behavior and longer-term macroeconomic patterns.

With the cleaned data infrastructure in place, the project facilitates a deeper understanding of economic dynamics over time. It enables analysis of financial volatility, identification of policy-relevant trends in monetary variables, and correlation of investment signals with market conditions. The structured dataset serves as a foundation for both retrospective analysis and forward-looking modeling, allowing practitioners to isolate key variables, benchmark economic performance, and inform strategic decision-making. The deliverable is not just a cleaned dataset, but a ready-to-query financial data environment that supports empirical exploration and analytical rigor.
